https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/submissions/1391023784/


Explanation:
Sliding Window Technique:

Use two pointers i and j, where i shrinks the window when a duplicate character is found, and j expands it as we iterate through the string.
HashSet:

A HashSet is used to track characters in the current window to ensure no duplicates.
Window Adjustment:

Whenever a duplicate character is found, the left side of the window is adjusted by removing characters from the set until the duplicate is eliminated.
Time Complexity:
O(n): Each character is processed at most twice (once added and once removed from the set).
This approach ensures an efficient and concise solution.
