Binary Search on Columns: Perform a binary search on the columns of the matrix to find the middle column.
Find Max in Middle Column: For each middle column, find the row that contains the maximum element in that column.
Peak Check: Compare the maximum element in the middle column with its left and right neighbors.
If the maximum element is greater than both neighbors, it is a peak, return its coordinates.
If the left neighbor is larger, move to the left half of the matrix.
If the right neighbor is larger, move to the right half of the matrix.
Repeat: Continue the binary search on the remaining columns until a peak is found.
