https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/

Binary Search on Ship Capacity: The ship's capacity is constrained between the maximum weight in the array and the sum of all weights.
Check Feasibility: For each capacity, check if it's possible to ship the weights within the allowed days by counting how many days it takes to load the weights given the capacity.
Adjust Search Range: If shipping is possible within the given days, reduce the capacity range. Otherwise, increase it.
Return Result: The smallest capacity that allows shipping within the allowed days is returned.
This approach uses binary search combined with a feasibility check, ensuring efficient computation.
