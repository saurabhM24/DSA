The need for the `volatile` keyword alongside the `synchronized` block depends on the specific use case and how the threads are accessing the shared variable. Let's break this down.

---

### **Synchronized and Visibility Guarantees**
- **Synchronized Block**:
  - The `synchronized` keyword ensures **visibility** and **atomicity**.
  - When a thread enters a `synchronized` block, it reads the most up-to-date value of the shared variable from the main memory.
  - When it exits the block, it flushes any updates back to the main memory, making them visible to other threads.

**Key Point**: If all threads access the shared variable only within `synchronized` blocks, you do not need the `volatile` keyword because `synchronized` already provides the necessary visibility guarantees.

---

### **When You Might Need Volatile**
You might need the `volatile` keyword in the following scenarios:

1. **Independent Reads/Writes Without Synchronization**:
   - If a variable is read by one thread and written by another thread **outside synchronized blocks**, `volatile` is required to ensure visibility.
   - Example:
     ```java
     private volatile boolean flag = false;

     public void writer() {
         flag = true; // Thread A writes
     }

     public void reader() {
         if (flag) {
             System.out.println("Flag is true"); // Thread B reads
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Lightweight Visibility Guarantee**:
   - `volatile` is a lighter alternative when you only need visibility but not atomicity or mutual exclusion.
   - Example: A flag to stop a thread (as shown above).

3. **Double-Checked Locking**:
   - In the double-checked locking pattern, `volatile` is required to prevent reordering of instructions during object initialization.
   - Example:
     ```java
     private static volatile Singleton instance;

     public static Singleton getInstance() {
         if (instance == null) {
             synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                 if (instance == null) {
                     instance = new Singleton();
                 }
             }
         }
         return instance;
     }
     ```

### **When You Don’t Need Volatile**
1. **Access Completely Within Synchronized Blocks**:
   - If all reads and writes to the shared variable occur within synchronized blocks or methods, `volatile` is unnecessary because the `synchronized` block already ensures visibility.

2. **Complex Atomic Operations**:
   - For operations requiring atomicity (e.g., incrementing a counter), `volatile` is insufficient because it doesn't provide atomicity. Use `synchronized` or `Atomic` classes instead.

### **Key Differences Between `synchronized` and `volatile`**
| Feature             | `synchronized`            | `volatile`                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Visibility**      | Ensures visibility.       | Ensures visibility.        |
| **Atomicity**       | Ensures atomicity.        | Does NOT ensure atomicity. |
| **Overhead**        | Higher (lock acquisition).| Lower (no locking).        |
| **Use Case**        | For complex operations.   | For simple flags or signals. |

---

### **Summary**
- If **all accesses** to the shared variable are within a `synchronized` block or method, you **don’t need `volatile`**.
- Use `volatile` for **simple visibility guarantees** when threads access a shared variable without additional synchronization.
- For **complex operations**, prefer `synchronized` or higher-level concurrency tools (e.g., `java.util.concurrent` classes).

Would you like examples of where combining `volatile` with `synchronized` is necessary?
