### Approach to Calculate Minimum Edit Distance

The given code implements a solution to the Minimum Edit Distance problem using recursion and memoization. Here's a concise breakdown of the approach:

1. **Problem Definition**: The goal is to transform one string (`s1`) into another (`s2`) using the minimum number of operations, which can be insertion, deletion, or replacement of characters.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: A 2D memoization table `t` is initialized to store intermediate results, avoiding redundant calculations.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If one string is empty, the minimum distance is the length of the other string (all insertions or deletions).
   
4. **Recursion**:
   - If the last characters of both strings match, recursively solve for the remaining substrings.
   - If they don't match, compute the minimum distance for:
     - Replacing the character (both strings decrease by 1).
     - Inserting a character in the first string (decrease `m` by 1).
     - Deleting a character from the first string (decrease `n` by 1).

5. **Final Calculation**: The result is stored in `t[n][m]`, which gives the minimum edit distance between `s1` and `s2`.

This approach efficiently calculates the minimum edit distance using a top-down dynamic programming method with memoization to optimize performance.
