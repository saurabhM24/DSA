The given code implements a dynamic programming solution for the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem with a focus on making a single buy and sell. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of the approach:

1. **State Definition**: The `solve` function considers two parameters: `i` (the current day) and `canBuy` (1 if we can buy, 0 if we can sell).

2. **Base Case**: If `i` exceeds the length of the prices array (`i >= n`), return 0, as no profit can be made.

3. **Memoization**: A 2D array `t` is used to cache results for each state, avoiding redundant calculations.

4. **Recursion Logic**:
   - If buying is allowed (`canBuy == 1`), we can either buy the stock (subtracting its price) or skip to the next day without buying.
   - If selling is allowed (`canBuy == 0`), we can either sell the stock (adding its price) and move to the day after the next (to account for the cooldown) or skip to the next day without selling.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum profit achievable based on the decisions made, leveraging memoization for efficiency.

This approach efficiently calculates the maximum profit from a single buy and sell, while incorporating a cooldown period after a sale.
