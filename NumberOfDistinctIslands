Approach
Initialize Data Structures:

Use a Set<Set<String>> to store the unique shapes of the islands.
Traverse the Grid:

Iterate over each cell in the grid. When a land cell (1) is found, initiate a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the entire island.
DFS Exploration and Shape Recording:

During the DFS, keep track of the starting position of the island (baseRow, baseCol).
For each cell in the island, calculate its relative position to the starting cell as row_offset = current_row - baseRow and col_offset = current_col - baseCol.
Record these relative positions in a set to represent the shape of the island.
Store and Compare Island Shapes:

After completing the DFS for an island, store its shape (set of relative positions) in the main set of unique island shapes.
This ensures that islands with the same shape (relative positions) are considered identical.
Count the Number of Distinct Islands:

The size of the main set of unique island shapes represents the number of distinct islands.
Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Each cell is visited once.
Space Complexity: O(m * n) for storing the shapes of the islands and the recursion stack in DFS.
