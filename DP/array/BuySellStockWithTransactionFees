https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/

The provided code solves the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee" problem using a dynamic programming approach. Here's a concise overview of the approach:

1. **State Definition**: The `solve` function tracks the current day (`i`), whether buying is allowed (`canBuy`), the total number of days (`n`), and the transaction fee.

2. **Base Case**: If `i` reaches or exceeds the length of the prices array (`i >= n`), return 0, as no profit can be made.

3. **Memoization**: A 2D array `t` is used to cache results for each state to optimize performance by avoiding redundant calculations.

4. **Recursion Logic**:
   - If buying is allowed (`canBuy == 1`), the options are to either buy the stock (subtract its price) or skip to the next day without buying.
   - If selling is allowed (`canBuy == 0`), the options are to sell the stock (add its price minus the transaction fee) or skip to the next day without selling.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum profit achievable based on the decisions made at each state, utilizing memoization for efficiency.

This approach effectively accounts for the transaction fee while maximizing the profit from stock trades.
