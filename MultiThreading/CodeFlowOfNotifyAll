When `counter.notifyAll()` is called within a synchronized block in Java, 
the following sequence of events occurs, and understanding how the code flow works is critical to correctly handling thread synchronization.

### Key Points to Understand

1. **Releasing Waiting Threads**:
   - `notifyAll()` wakes up all threads that are waiting on the `counter` object's monitor.
   - These threads are moved from the "waiting" state to the "runnable" state. However, they do not execute immediately.

2. **Current Thread Continues**:
   - The current thread (the one calling `notifyAll()`) continues execution of the synchronized block and holds the lock on the `counter` object.
   - The subsequent five print statements will execute uninterrupted because no other thread can enter the synchronized block until the current thread exits it.

3. **Exiting the Synchronized Block**:
   - Once the synchronized block is exited, the current thread releases the lock on the `counter` object.
   - Only then can the threads in the "runnable" state attempt to acquire the lock.

4. **Thread Scheduling**:
   - Once the lock is released, the waiting threads (now runnable) will compete to reacquire the lock.
   - The JVM's thread scheduler decides which thread will get the lock next. This decision depends on the JVM's implementation and is not deterministic.

### Example Code to Illustrate
```java
public class NotifyExample {
    private static final Object counter = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread waitingThread = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (counter) {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Waiting thread: Waiting for notification...");
                    counter.wait();
                    System.out.println("Waiting thread: Notified and resumed.");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });

        waitingThread.start();

        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Ensure waitingThread enters waiting state.
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        synchronized (counter) {
            System.out.println("Main thread: Calling notifyAll...");
            counter.notifyAll();
            System.out.println("Main thread: Continuing execution...");
            System.out.println("Main thread: Doing work...");
            System.out.println("Main thread: Finishing up...");
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Waiting thread: Waiting for notification...
Main thread: Calling notifyAll...
Main thread: Continuing execution...
Main thread: Doing work...
Main thread: Finishing up...
Waiting thread: Notified and resumed.
```

### What Happens Internally After `notifyAll()`:
1. **The Waiting Threads**:
   - All threads waiting on `counter.wait()` are moved to the runnable state but remain blocked because the lock is still held by the current thread.
   
2. **Execution Continues in Current Thread**:
   - The current thread completes all statements within the synchronized block before releasing the lock.

3. **Lock Release**:
   - Once the current thread exits the synchronized block, the lock on the `counter` object is released.

4. **Thread Competition**:
   - The waiting threads now compete to acquire the lock. Only one thread can successfully acquire it and continue execution.

This flow ensures the current thread finishes its critical section without interruption, while other threads waiting for the monitor can proceed only after the lock is released.
