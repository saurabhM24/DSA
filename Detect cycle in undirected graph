Time Complexity: O(V + 2E) 2E for undirected graph
Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited and parent arrays.

1. Using Depth-First Search (DFS)
In DFS, you can detect a cycle by keeping track of visited nodes and the parent node of each node. If you encounter a node that has been visited and is not the parent of the current node, then there is a cycle.

Steps:

Use a DFS traversal from each unvisited node.
During DFS, maintain a parent variable to track the parent of each node.
If you encounter a node that is visited and is not the parent of the current node, a cycle is detected.
