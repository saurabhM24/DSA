Approach: Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
The Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) algorithm is an effective way to solve this problem. The idea is to detect cycles in the graph using Union-Find.

Key Idea:
Union-Find Operations:

Find: Determine which component (or subset) a particular element is in.
Union: Merge two subsets into a single subset.
Cycle Detection: If two nodes are already in the same subset and an edge connecting them is found, that edge is the redundant connection.
Process:

Iterate over each edge in the graph.
For each edge, check if the two vertices of the edge are already connected (i.e., they share the same root).
If they are connected, this edge is redundant.
If they are not connected, union the two vertices.
Output:

Return the first edge that creates a cycle.
