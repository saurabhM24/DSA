Approach:
To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

Graph Representation:

Use an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each node points to a list of (neighbor, weight) pairs.
Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Initialize a priority queue to explore the nodes by the shortest known distance.
Start with the source node K, and set its distance to 0.
Pop nodes from the priority queue, updating the shortest path to their neighbors.
Track the maximum time it takes to reach any node from K.
Result:

If all nodes are reachable, return the maximum time from the starting node K to any other node.
If any node is unreachable, return -1.

Time Complexity: O(V+ElogV)
