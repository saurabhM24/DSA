The **Circuit Breaker Pattern** is a design pattern used to handle fault tolerance in distributed systems by preventing repeated attempts to call a failing service. 
The circuit breaker typically operates in three main states:

---

### **1. Closed State**
- **Description**: The circuit breaker allows requests to flow through to the dependent service.
- **Behavior**:
  - If the service responds successfully, the circuit remains closed.
  - If a certain threshold of failures is reached (e.g., consecutive failures or a failure rate over a percentage), the circuit breaker transitions to the **Open** state.
- **Key Metrics**: Tracks failure count or failure rate.

---

### **2. Open State**
- **Description**: The circuit breaker stops requests from being sent to the dependent service. Instead, it immediately returns an error or fallback response.
- **Behavior**:
  - The breaker enters this state after detecting a threshold of failures in the **Closed** state.
  - Requests are blocked for a specific timeout period.
  - After the timeout, the breaker transitions to the **Half-Open** state to test if the service has recovered.
  
---

### **3. Half-Open State**
- **Description**: The circuit breaker allows a limited number of requests to pass through to the dependent service to test if it has recovered.
- **Behavior**:
  - If the test requests succeed, the circuit transitions back to the **Closed** state.
  - If the test requests fail, the circuit transitions back to the **Open** state.

### **State Transition Diagram**
1. **Closed → Open**: Triggered when the failure threshold is breached.
2. **Open → Half-Open**: After a timeout period.
3. **Half-Open → Closed**: Triggered if test requests succeed.
4. **Half-Open → Open**: Triggered if test requests fail.

### **State Summary**

| **State**       | **Requests Behavior**                         | **Transition**                                                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Closed**       | All requests pass through to the service.     | Transitions to **Open** on failure threshold breach.                  |
| **Open**         | Requests are blocked, and fallback is used.   | Transitions to **Half-Open** after a timeout period.                  |
| **Half-Open**    | Limited test requests pass through.           | Transitions to **Closed** on success or back to **Open** on failure.  |

### **Example Use Case**
Suppose a microservice calls a remote payment gateway:

1. **Normal Operation (Closed)**:
   - The payment gateway is healthy, and all requests are processed successfully.

2. **Failure Detected (Open)**:
   - The gateway starts failing. After reaching the failure threshold (e.g., 5 consecutive failures), the circuit breaker moves to the **Open** state and blocks further requests.

3. **Recovery Check (Half-Open)**:
   - After a timeout, a few requests are sent to the payment gateway. If they succeed, the breaker transitions to **Closed**; otherwise, it reopens.

---

### **Benefits of Circuit Breaker States**
- **Closed**: Optimizes for normal operations by allowing uninterrupted service.
- **Open**: Protects the system from cascading failures by preventing further load on a failing service.
- **Half-Open**: Ensures service recovery is gracefully detected.
