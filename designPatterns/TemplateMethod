Let's refine the **Template Method Design Pattern** example for payment processing,
incorporating the specific steps of **validate**, **debit**, **credit**, and **send receipt**.
Each payment method will implement these steps accordingly.

### 1. Abstract Class

```java
public abstract class Payment {
    // Template method
    public final void processPayment() {
        validate();
        debit();
        credit();
        sendReceipt();
    }

    protected abstract void validate();
    protected abstract void debit();
    protected abstract void credit();

    private void sendReceipt() {
        System.out.println("Sending receipt to the customer.");
    }
}
```

### 2. Concrete Classes

#### Credit Card Payment

```java
public class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    @Override
    protected void validate() {
        System.out.println("Validating credit card details.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void debit() {
        System.out.println("Debiting amount from credit card.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void credit() {
        System.out.println("Crediting payment to the merchant's account.");
    }
}
```

#### PayPal Payment

```java
public class PayPalPayment extends Payment {
    @Override
    protected void validate() {
        System.out.println("Validating PayPal account.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void debit() {
        System.out.println("Debiting amount from PayPal account.");
    }

    @Override
    protected void credit() {
        System.out.println("Crediting payment to the merchant's PayPal account.");
    }
}
```

### 3. Client Code

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment creditCardPayment = new CreditCardPayment();
        creditCardPayment.processPayment();

        System.out.println();

        Payment paypalPayment = new PayPalPayment();
        paypalPayment.processPayment();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Payment Class**: This is the abstract class that defines the `processPayment()` template method,
which outlines the steps of the payment process: **validate**, **debit**, **credit**, and **send receipt**. 
The `sendReceipt()` method is a concrete implementation, while `validate()`, `debit()`, and `credit()` are abstract methods that subclasses must implement.

2. **CreditCardPayment Class**: Implements the specific steps for processing a credit card payment:
   - **validate()**: Validates credit card details.
   - **debit()**: Debits the amount from the credit card.
   - **credit()**: Credits the payment to the merchant's account.

3. **PayPalPayment Class**: Similar to the `CreditCardPayment`, but implements the specific steps for PayPal payments:
   - **validate()**: Validates the PayPal account.
   - **debit()**: Debits the amount from the PayPal account.
   - **credit()**: Credits the payment to the merchant's PayPal account.

4. **Client**: This code creates instances of `CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment` and calls the `processPayment()` method,
demonstrating the specific behaviors of each payment method while following the same overall process.

### Benefits of This Design

- **Clear Structure**: The payment process is clearly defined with each step encapsulated, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Extensibility**: New payment methods can be easily added by creating new subclasses without altering the existing code.
- **Consistency**: All payment methods follow the same processing structure, ensuring a uniform approach to payment processing.

### Conclusion

Using the Template Method Design Pattern in this payment processing example helps create a structured and maintainable system where specific payment methods can implement their own logic while adhering to a consistent workflow.
