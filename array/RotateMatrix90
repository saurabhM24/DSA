The approach to rotating a square matrix by 90 degrees clockwise involves two main steps:

Transpose the Matrix: Swap the elements across the main diagonal. For each element at position (i, j), swap it with the element at (j, i). This effectively flips the matrix over its diagonal.

Reverse Each Row: After transposing, reverse each row of the matrix. This step transforms the transposed matrix into the final rotated state.

By combining these two operations, the matrix is efficiently rotated in-place, achieving the desired transformation with O(nÂ²) time complexity and O(1) additional space.
