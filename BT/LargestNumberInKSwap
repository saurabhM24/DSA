Hereâ€™s the approach to solve the Largest Number in K Swaps problem in a few lines:

Backtracking: Use recursion to explore all possible swaps up to K times.
For each recursion:
Swap the current digit with all subsequent larger digits.
After each swap, recursively solve the problem with K-1 swaps remaining.
Keep track of the largest number encountered.
Prune Unnecessary Swaps: If the current digit is already the largest in its remaining range, move to the next digit without reducing K.
Backtrack after each recursion by undoing the swap to explore other possibilities.
