The provided solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to solve the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem. Here's a concise approach breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: A 2D array `t` is created to store the minimum multiplication costs for subproblems. It is initialized with `-1` to indicate uncomputed states.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - The `solve` function computes the minimum cost to multiply matrices from index `i` to `j`.
   - If `i + 1 == j`, it means only one matrix is present, so the cost is `0`.
   - If the cost for the subproblem `(i, j)` is already computed, return the cached value.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Iterate through all possible split points `k` (from `i+1` to `j-1`).
   - For each split, calculate the cost of multiplying the left and right parts and add the cost of multiplying the resulting matrices.
   - Update the minimum cost if the current configuration yields a lower cost.

4. **Memoization**: Store the computed cost in `t[i][j]` to avoid redundant calculations.

### Time Complexity
- **O(N³)**: The solution has three nested loops: two for the range of matrices (i, j) and one for the split point (k), leading to cubic time complexity, where `N` is the number of matrices.

Sure! Let's break down the time complexity of the Matrix Chain Multiplication solution in more detail:

### Components of the Time Complexity

1. **Outer Loop (i, j)**:
   - The solution iterates through all pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `0 ≤ i < j < N`. 
   - The number of valid pairs of `(i, j)` is approximately \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( O(N^2) \).

2. **Inner Loop (k)**:
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, the code iterates through potential split points `k` from `i + 1` to `j - 1`. 
   - The number of possible `k` values for each `(i, j)` is at most \( j - i - 1 \), which can be at most \( N \) in the worst case. 
   - Therefore, this loop contributes an additional factor of \( O(N) \).

### Total Time Complexity

Combining these parts, the overall time complexity is:
\[
O(N^2) \text{ (for pairs of } (i, j)) \times O(N) \text{ (for splits } k) = O(N^3)
\]

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \( O(N^2) \) due to the `t` matrix used for memoization, which stores the minimum multiplication costs for subproblems.

In summary, the final time complexity for the algorithm is \( O(N^3) \), which arises from the nested loops iterating through possible pairs of matrix indices and their respective split points.
