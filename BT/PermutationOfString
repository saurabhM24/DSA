Approach:
Swap characters recursively to generate permutations by fixing each character at the current position.
Backtrack by restoring the previous state after each recursive call to explore other possibilities.
Add permutations to a result list when the base case (end of the string) is reached.
This approach ensures all permutations of the string are explored and added to the result.

TC: O(n!)
