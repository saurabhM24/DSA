Solution Approach
This problem can also be solved using Topological Sorting to detect if there is a cycle in the graph:

Graph Representation: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph.

In-Degree Calculation: Compute the in-degrees for all nodes.

Cycle Detection:

Use Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS-based) or DFS-based approach to try to generate a topological order.
If you can process all nodes (i.e., the number of nodes processed equals numCourses), there’s no cycle, and it’s possible to complete all courses.
If you cannot process all nodes, there is a cycle, and it’s not possible to complete all courses.
