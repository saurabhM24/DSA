https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/description/

The problem "Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal" on LeetCode requires you to reconstruct a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversal sequences.

Problem Breakdown
Preorder Traversal: Visits nodes in the order: root -> left subtree -> right subtree.
Inorder Traversal: Visits nodes in the order: left subtree -> root -> right subtree.
Approach to Solve the Problem
To reconstruct the binary tree, the key insight is that:

The first element in the preorder list is always the root of the current subtree.
In the inorder list, the root splits the list into the left and right subtrees.
Steps to Construct the Tree
Identify the root: The first element in the preorder list is the root of the tree.

Find the root in the inorder list: This helps determine the boundary between the left and right subtrees.

Recursively construct the left and right subtrees:

The left subtree consists of all nodes before the root in the inorder list.
The right subtree consists of all nodes after the root in the inorder list.
Use the corresponding elements from the preorder list for the left and right subtrees.
Recur until the tree is fully constructed.
