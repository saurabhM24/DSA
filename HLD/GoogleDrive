Yes, when designing a system like Google Drive for file storage and synchronization, the concept of sending only the changed chunks or blocks of a file (often referred to as "deltas" or "differential sync") is crucial for efficiency. Hereâ€™s how it generally works:

### 1. **Chunking the File**

- **File Division**: Large files are divided into smaller, manageable chunks or blocks. This can be done based on fixed sizes (e.g., 1 MB chunks) or variable sizes, depending on the implementation.
- **Metadata Storage**: Each chunk may have associated metadata, including a unique identifier, size, and a hash for integrity checks.

### 2. **Detecting Changes**

- **Local Modification Detection**: When a file is modified, the client application (e.g., Google Drive app) detects these changes. This can be done through file system monitoring or manual checks.
- **Checksum Calculation**: The application calculates checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) for each chunk of the file to identify which chunks have changed.

### 3. **Delta Creation**

- **Comparing Chunks**: The modified file is compared to the last synced version. By calculating checksums for both the original and modified chunks, the application determines which chunks have changed.
- **Change Identification**: Only the chunks with differing checksums are marked for upload.

### 4. **Uploading Changed Chunks**

- **Efficient Upload**: The client uploads only the modified chunks to the server. This minimizes bandwidth usage and speeds up the synchronization process.
- **Order and Integrity**: Chunks may be uploaded in a specific order, and the server should verify the integrity of each chunk upon receipt.

### 5. **Server-Side Handling**

- **Chunk Storage**: The server stores the new or updated chunks. If a chunk already exists (i.e., it has not changed), the server can skip storing it again, further saving space.
- **Reassembly**: When a user requests a file, the server assembles it from the stored chunks. This can be done on-the-fly or when a download request is made.

### 6. **Version Control and Conflict Resolution**

- **Versioning**: The system may keep multiple versions of files, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Conflict Handling**: If a file is modified from multiple clients simultaneously, the server must implement conflict resolution strategies, such as merging changes or prompting the user for action.

### Benefits

- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Sending only the changed chunks significantly reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network.
- **Faster Synchronization**: Users experience quicker sync times, especially for large files with minor modifications.
- **Storage Optimization**: The server can reduce storage redundancy by keeping only unique chunks.

### Conclusion

The differential sync method is a critical component in designing cloud storage solutions like Google Drive.
By focusing on changes rather than re-uploading entire files, such systems can operate efficiently and provide a better user experience.
