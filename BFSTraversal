## BFS Traversal Time Complexity

### Node Processing

Each node is enqueued and dequeued exactly once. Therefore, processing all nodes takes `O(N)` time.

### Edge Processing

- For each node, BFS examines all its neighbors.
- If a node `u` has `d(u)` neighbors (where `d(u)` is the degree of node `u`), examining all neighbors across all nodes involves examining all edges.
- The total number of operations across all nodes for edge examination is the sum of the degrees of all nodes, which is `2E` for an undirected graph (since each edge is counted twice, once from each endpoint).
- Hence, the edge processing time is `O(2E)`.
