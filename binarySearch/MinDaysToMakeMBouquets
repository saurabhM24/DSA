Binary Search on Days:

Find the minimum and maximum bloom days from the bloomDay array. Perform a binary search between these values to find the smallest number of days required to make m bouquets.
Feasibility Check:

For each midpoint day midDay, use the isPossible function to check if it's possible to make at least m bouquets by that day. A bouquet can only be made if k consecutive flowers have bloomed by midDay.
Update Bounds:

If m bouquets can be made, reduce the search space (r = midDay - 1) to check if an earlier day also works. If not, increase the lower bound (l = midDay + 1).
Time Complexity:

Binary search over days takes O(log(max-min)) and each feasibility check takes O(n), resulting in an overall complexity of O(n log(max-min)).
This approach efficiently finds the minimum day to create the desired number of bouquets.
