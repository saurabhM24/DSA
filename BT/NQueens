The approach to solving the N-Queens problem typically involves backtracking:

Place Queens Recursively:

Start placing queens row by row. For each row, try placing a queen in every column.
Check Validity:

Before placing a queen in a column, ensure that no other queens are attacking it by checking:
Same column
Same diagonal (both left and right diagonals)
Backtracking:

If a valid placement is found, move to the next row.
If no valid placement is possible in the current row, backtrack (remove the last placed queen) and try the next column in the previous row.
Store Valid Solutions:

Once all queens are placed validly on the board, store the current configuration as a solution.
Key Components:
Recursive function to place queens.
Helper functions to validate placement.
Backtrack when necessary and try other possibilities.
