To solve the problem of finding the order of characters in an alien language given a sorted dictionary, you can use a topological sort approach. The idea is to build a directed graph where each node represents a character, and a directed edge from character u to character v indicates that u comes before v in the alien language.

Approach
Build the Graph:

Compare adjacent words in the dictionary. For each pair of words, find the first character that differs. This differing character determines the ordering of the characters in the alien language.
Create a directed edge from the first differing character of the first word to the first differing character of the second word.
Topological Sort:

Perform a topological sort on the graph to determine the order of characters. Topological sort is valid because the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
