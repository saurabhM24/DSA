This approach works by leveraging the properties of the matrix being sorted both row-wise and column-wise:

Start from the top-right corner of the matrix (i.e., matrix[0][m-1]).
If the current element equals the target, return true.
If the target is smaller than the current element, move left (decrement j).
If the target is larger, move down (increment i).
Continue until you either find the target or exhaust the matrix.
This method runs in O(n + m) time, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.
