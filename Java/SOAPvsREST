### **Differences Between SOAP and REST**

| **Aspect**              | **SOAP**                                              | **REST**                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Type**                | Protocol with strict standards.                      | Architectural style, more flexible.         |
| **Message Format**      | Always XML.                                           | JSON, XML, HTML, etc. (JSON preferred).     |
| **Transport Protocol**  | Works over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.                     | Only HTTP.                                  |
| **Complexity**          | Complex and heavy.                                   | Simple and lightweight.                     |
| **Performance**         | Slower due to XML parsing and overhead.              | Faster, consumes less bandwidth.            |
| **Security**            | Built-in WS-Security for advanced security needs.    | Relies on SSL/TLS and HTTP mechanisms.      |
| **Statefulness**        | Supports both stateful and stateless operations.     | Stateless by design.                        |
| **Use Case**            | Best for enterprise systems (e.g., banking).         | Best for web, mobile, and public APIs.      |
