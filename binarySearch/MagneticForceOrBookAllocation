Approach in few lines:
Sort the array: Sort the positions of the elements to ensure they are in ascending order.
Binary Search on Maximum Distance: Use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum distance between any two balls.
Start with l = 1 (minimum possible distance) and r = position[n-1] - position[0] (maximum possible distance between the first and last positions).
Check Feasibility: For each midpoint distance (dist), check if it's possible to place m balls with at least dist distance using a helper function canWePlace().
If it's possible, move to larger distances (increase l).
Otherwise, reduce the distance (decrease r).
Return the Result: The binary search will eventually return the maximum possible minimum distance.
Code Explanation:
canWePlace() checks if m balls can be placed with at least dist distance between them by iterating through the sorted positions.
This ensures we find the maximum distance that allows placing all m balls.
