### **Compare and Swap (CAS)**

---

#### **Definition**
Compare and Swap (CAS) is a low-level atomic operation used in concurrent programming to achieve thread-safe synchronization without using locks. It ensures that a value is updated only if it matches an expected value, providing the foundation for many non-blocking algorithms.

---

#### **How CAS Works**
1. **Compare**:
   - Check if the current value in memory matches an expected value.
2. **Swap**:
   - If they match, update the memory with a new value.
   - If not, the operation fails, and the thread may retry.

---

#### **CAS in Java**
The `compareAndSet` method, found in classes like `AtomicInteger` (from `java.util.concurrent.atomic`), provides CAS functionality.

**Method Signature**:
```java
boolean compareAndSet(int expectedValue, int newValue);
```

- **`expectedValue`**: The value you think the variable currently holds.
- **`newValue`**: The value you want to set if `expectedValue` matches.
- **Returns**: `true` if the update is successful, `false` otherwise.

---

#### **Advantages of CAS**
1. **Non-Blocking**:
   - Threads don’t get blocked, improving throughput in multi-threaded applications.
2. **Performance**:
   - Avoids the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks.
3. **Deadlock-Free**:
   - Since no locks are used, CAS prevents deadlocks.

---

#### **Disadvantages of CAS**
1. **Busy-Waiting**:
   - Threads retrying the operation in a loop may lead to high CPU usage.
2. **ABA Problem**:
   - If a variable changes from `A → B → A`, CAS may incorrectly detect no change.
   - **Solution**: Use version numbers or tools like `StampedLock` to handle ABA.
3. **Complexity**:
   - Writing non-blocking algorithms using CAS is more complex than using traditional locks.

#### **Example of CAS**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class CompareAndSwapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicInteger atomicCounter = new AtomicInteger(0);

        // Attempt to update value from 0 to 1
        boolean isUpdated = atomicCounter.compareAndSet(0, 1);
        System.out.println("Updated: " + isUpdated + ", Current Value: " + atomicCounter.get());

        // Attempt to update value from 0 to 2 (this will fail)
        isUpdated = atomicCounter.compareAndSet(0, 2);
        System.out.println("Updated: " + isUpdated + ", Current Value: " + atomicCounter.get());

        // Successful update from 1 to 2
        isUpdated = atomicCounter.compareAndSet(1, 2);
        System.out.println("Updated: " + isUpdated + ", Current Value: " + atomicCounter.get());
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Updated: true, Current Value: 1
Updated: false, Current Value: 1
Updated: true, Current Value: 2
```

#### **CAS and Visibility Guarantee**
1. **Memory Barriers**:
   - CAS relies on low-level atomic instructions that include memory barriers to ensure proper visibility across threads.
   - Memory barriers ensure no reordering of reads and writes occurs around the CAS operation.

2. **Volatile Variables**:
   - CAS operations in Java (like `compareAndSet`) operate on variables marked as `volatile`, ensuring that changes are immediately visible to other threads.

3. **Happens-Before Relationship**:
   - A successful CAS establishes a happens-before relationship:
     - All writes made before the CAS are visible to other threads reading the updated value.

---

#### **Use Cases**
1. **Atomic Counters**:
   - Increment or decrement counters in a thread-safe, lock-free manner.
2. **Lock-Free Data Structures**:
   - Implement stacks, queues, or other concurrent collections.
3. **Spin Locks**:
   - Useful for implementing basic locking mechanisms in certain scenarios.
4. **Optimistic Concurrency Control**:
   - Works well when conflicts are rare.

---

#### **Key Points**
1. **Definition**: CAS is an atomic operation that updates a value if and only if it matches an expected value.
2. **API**: `compareAndSet(expectedValue, newValue)`
3. **Advantages**: Non-blocking, deadlock-free, and performant.
4. **Disadvantages**: Can lead to busy-waiting, suffers from the ABA problem, and is complex to implement.
5. **Visibility**: CAS ensures visibility of changes across threads due to memory barriers and volatile semantics.

---

### **Additional Notes**
- **ABA Problem**:
   - Use versioned values (like `AtomicStampedReference`) to avoid this issue.
- **Retry Mechanism**:
   - For contention-heavy scenarios, consider backoff strategies to reduce busy-waiting.
