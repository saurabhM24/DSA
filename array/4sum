https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/


The provided code solves the "4Sum" problem, aiming to find all unique quadruplets in an array that sum to a given target. Here’s a concise approach breakdown:

Sorting: The input array is sorted to facilitate efficient handling of duplicates and to enable the two-pointer technique.

Outer Loop for i: Iterate through the array with index i to fix the first element of the quadruplet, skipping duplicates to avoid repeated results.

Inner Loop for j: Use a nested loop with index j to fix the second element, again skipping duplicates.

Two-Pointer Technique: Initialize two pointers, k (starting after j) and l (at the end of the array):

Calculate the sum of the elements at indices i, j, k, and l.
If the sum matches the target, store the quadruplet and skip duplicates for both k and l.
If the sum is less than the target, increment k to increase the sum.
If the sum is greater than the target, decrement l to decrease the sum.
Result Collection: Gather all unique quadruplets into a list and return it.
