Here's a concise overview of join, priority, and daemon threads:

### 1. Join
- **Definition**: The `join()` method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.
- **Usage**: When a thread calls `join()` on another thread, it blocks until the specified thread has finished executing. This is useful for ensuring that a thread has completed its task before proceeding.
- **Example**: 
  ```python
  thread.join()  # Waits for 'thread' to finish.
  ```

### 2. Priority
- **Definition**: Thread priority is a mechanism that determines the order in which threads are scheduled for execution.
- **Usage**: Threads can be assigned different priority levels, which can influence the thread scheduler's behavior. Higher priority threads may be executed before lower priority threads, though this is not guaranteed.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY)  # Set the thread to high priority.
  ```

### 3. Daemon Thread
- **Definition**: A daemon thread is a thread that runs in the background and does not prevent the program from exiting.
- **Usage**: Daemon threads are typically used for tasks that run in the background (like garbage collection). When all non-daemon threads finish executing, the program exits, regardless of the state of daemon threads.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  thread.setDaemon(True)  # Marks 'thread' as a daemon thread.
  ```

### Summary
- **Join**: Waits for another thread to finish.
- **Priority**: Determines the scheduling order of threads.
- **Daemon Thread**: Background thread that does not block program termination.
