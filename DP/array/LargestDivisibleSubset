https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/
Note: This is very similar to longest increasing subsequence approach.

The provided code finds the largest divisible subset from an array of integers using a dynamic programming approach. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the input array `nums` to facilitate checking divisibility in a structured manner.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Create an array `count` where `count[i]` holds the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.
   - Create a `hash` array to track the previous index in the subset for reconstructing the solution.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, iterate through all previous elements `nums[prev]`.
   - If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[prev]`, update `count[i]` and `hash[i]` to reflect that `nums[i]` can extend the subset ending with `nums[prev]`.

4. **Finding the Maximum**: After populating the `count` array, find the maximum value and its index, which indicates the largest divisible subset.

5. **Reconstructing the Subset**: Using the `hash` array, reconstruct the largest divisible subset by backtracking from the index of the maximum count.

6. **Reversal**: Since the subset is constructed in reverse order, reverse the list before returning it.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array, due to the nested loops. 

### Output
- The method returns a list containing the elements of the largest divisible subset.
