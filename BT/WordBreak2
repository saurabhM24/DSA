Backtracking with Recursion:

The method recursively breaks the string s by checking each substring starting from the current index (start).
If the substring matches a word in the dictionary (wordSet), it's added to the current list (wordList) and the recursion continues.
Base Case:

When the end of the string is reached, the words in wordList form a valid sequence, which is then joined into a sentence and added to the result list ans.
Backtracking:

After checking each valid substring, the method backtracks by removing the last word from wordList to explore other possibilities.
StringBuilder is used to efficiently concatenate words into the final result.
