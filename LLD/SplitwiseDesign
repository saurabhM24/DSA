There is Simplify the balance logic. Look at it.
We can use strategy design pattern for expense split strategy. Eg: Split by percentage, equal, unequal 
Main classes are:
Expense,
ExpenseController,
User,
Group,
User class will maintain a balance sheet as each user has different view. 
The Balance sheet will have map of user and Balance. The Balance class will have moneyOwe and moneyGetBack;
