Approach :
Identify and Mark Boundary-Connected Regions:

Traverse the boundary of the matrix and start a Depth-First Search (DFS) from each 'O' found. Mark all connected 'O' cells as a temporary character (e.g., 'E').
These cells are not surrounded and should not be flipped to 'X'.
Flip Surrounded Regions:

Traverse the entire board. Any 'O' that has not been marked by the DFS is surrounded by 'X' and should be flipped to 'X'.
Convert the temporary character 'E' back to 'O' to restore the original unsurrrounded regions.
