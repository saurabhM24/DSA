In Kubernetes, the **Kubernetes networking model** is responsible for assigning IP addresses to service components. Here's how it works:

1. **Pod IP Addresses**:
   - Each **Pod** in a Kubernetes cluster gets its own unique IP address from the **Kubernetes network**. The network is set up by the **network plugin** (such as Calico, Flannel, or Cilium) that your cluster uses.
   - The Kubernetes control plane ensures that Pods across different nodes can communicate with each other using their IP addresses.

2. **Service IP Addresses**:
   - Kubernetes also manages **Services**, which are abstractions that expose a set of Pods to clients.
   - A **ClusterIP** (the default type of service) is automatically assigned to a Kubernetes **Service** when it's created. This is a virtual IP address that is internal to the cluster and can be used by clients to reach the service, regardless of where the Pods for that service are running.
   - The assignment of the ClusterIP is done by the **kube-apiserver**, which assigns a static IP from a pre-defined IP range for services.

3. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Kubernetes also provides **DNS** (usually via CoreDNS) to resolve service names to IP addresses. For example, if you have a service called `my-service`, Kubernetes can resolve `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local` to the appropriate IP address for that service.

### To summarize:
- **Pods** get IPs from the Kubernetes network, managed by the network plugin.
- **Services** get IPs (ClusterIPs) from a pool of addresses defined in the Kubernetes configuration, typically managed by the kube-apiserver.
- DNS is used to map service names to their assigned IP addresses, providing ease of discovery within the cluster.
