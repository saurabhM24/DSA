https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

The provided code implements the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find the majority element in an array, which is the element that appears more than 
𝑛
/
2
n/2 times. Here's a brief overview of the approach:

Initialization: Start with a candidate (element) and a count (cnt) set to zero.
Iteration: Traverse the array:
If the current number matches the candidate, increment the count.
If it doesn't match and the count is zero, update the candidate to the current number and reset the count to one.
If it doesn't match and the count is not zero, decrement the count.
Result: After the loop, the candidate will be the majority element, which is returned.
This algorithm runs in 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) time complexity and uses 
𝑂
(

)
O(1) space, making it efficient for this problem.
