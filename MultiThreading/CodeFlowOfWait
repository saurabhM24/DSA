The behavior of `wait()` is different from `notifyAll()` in how it interacts with the synchronization mechanism. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **What Happens When `wait()` is Called?**

1. **Thread Goes to the Waiting State:**
   - When a thread calls `wait()` on an object (e.g., `counter.wait()`), it immediately **releases the lock on that object**.
   - The thread moves to the **waiting state** and waits until it is notified via `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.

2. **Other Threads Can Acquire the Lock:**
   - Since the lock is released, other threads waiting to enter the synchronized block on the same object can now acquire the lock and proceed with their execution.

3. **Thread Resumes When Notified:**
   - When the waiting thread is notified (via `notify()` or `notifyAll()`), it moves to the **runnable state** but does not immediately resume execution.
   - The thread must reacquire the lock on the object before it can continue from where it left off.

4. **Code After `wait()`:**
   - After the waiting thread reacquires the lock, it resumes execution from the line immediately after the `wait()` call.

### **Code Flow After `wait()`**

Hereâ€™s an example to understand the flow better:

#### Example Code:
```java
public class WaitNotifyExample {
    private static final Object counter = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread waitingThread = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (counter) {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Waiting thread: Waiting...");
                    counter.wait(); // Releases the lock and waits
                    System.out.println("Waiting thread: Resumed after notification!");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });

        waitingThread.start();

        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Allow waitingThread to enter waiting state
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        synchronized (counter) {
            System.out.println("Main thread: Notifying...");
            counter.notify(); // Notify the waiting thread
            System.out.println("Main thread: Continuing work...");
        }
    }
```

#### Output:
```
Waiting thread: Waiting...
Main thread: Notifying...
Main thread: Continuing work...
Waiting thread: Resumed after notification!
```

### **Steps in the Code Flow:**

1. **`waitingThread` Starts:**
   - Acquires the lock on `counter` and enters the synchronized block.
   - Calls `counter.wait()`, releasing the lock and moving to the waiting state.

2. **Main Thread Executes:**
   - Acquires the lock on `counter` and enters the synchronized block.
   - Calls `notify()`, moving `waitingThread` from the waiting state to the runnable state.
   - Releases the lock after completing its synchronized block.

3. **`waitingThread` Resumes:**
   - Reacquires the lock on `counter`.
   - Continues execution from the line after `counter.wait()`.

### **Key Differences Between `wait()` and `notifyAll()`:**

| Feature                  | `wait()`                                           | `notifyAll()`                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Effect on Current Thread** | Causes the current thread to release the lock and wait. | Wakes up all threads waiting on the same lock. |
| **Effect on Other Threads**  | Other threads can acquire the lock after `wait()`. | The current thread continues until it releases the lock. |
| **Thread State**           | Moves the current thread to the waiting state.   | Moves all waiting threads to the runnable state. |
| **Resume Execution**       | A thread resumes only after being notified and reacquiring the lock. | Waiting threads resume based on lock availability. |

### **Code Flow After `wait()` (Summary):**

1. The thread releases the lock on the monitor object.
2. It moves to the waiting state.
3. It waits to be notified (via `notify()` or `notifyAll()`).
4. When notified, it moves to the runnable state.
5. It reacquires the lock when available.
6. Resumes execution from the line after the `wait()` call.

This ensures a thread pauses its execution and allows other threads to proceed, creating a synchronization mechanism for inter-thread communication.
