The `findContentChildren` function uses a greedy approach to maximize the number of content children based on their greed factors and the sizes of cookies available. Here's the breakdown of the approach in a few lines:

1. **Sort Arrays**: Both the greed factors of the children (`g`) and the sizes of the cookies (`s`) are sorted in ascending order. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest cookie that can satisfy each child's greed.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: 
   - A pointer (`j`) is used to track the cookies while iterating through each child's greed factor (`g[i]`).
   - For each child, the algorithm checks if the current cookie (`s[j]`) can satisfy the child's greed (`g[i]`).
   - If a cookie satisfies a child, both the child and the cookie pointers are advanced. If not, only the cookie pointer is advanced to check the next larger cookie.

3. **Count Satisfied Children**: Each time a child's greed is satisfied, a counter (`cnt`) is incremented.

4. **Return the Count**: Finally, the function returns the total count of content children.

This greedy algorithm efficiently ensures that each child gets the smallest cookie that meets their greed requirement, maximizing the number of satisfied children.
